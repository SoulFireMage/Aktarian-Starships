However, to do this, they communicate with the given universe. The first pair of ships were to be what we might call pure blood, solely machine in origin. However, space folding was extremely distressing and difficult for these ships. The problem was solved by the ultimate grandmother of the race who determined that the missing ingredient existed in sentient races of a certain capacity. \r\n\r\nAll her descendents are half breeds, just as immortal as she but folding space and other forms of FTL travel are as natural to these ships as breathing is to a mammal.\r\n\r\nThis project is my ongoing exploration of blender for the 3D work - it's a big area 3D design & animation, one I started in November 2014. Along with the project there are story snippets and ideas on their home site. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
