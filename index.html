<p>Meet the family!</p>

<ul>
<li>Myelia - uncountably ancient due to her origins, she's the last adult Aktarian female.</li>
<li>Katiya - daughter of Myelia and Allen, her human partner</li>
<li>Gemima - an orphan Aktarian, similar age to Katiya, her origins are unknown</li>
<li>Allen - human partner to Myelia</li>
</ul>

<p>All Aktarians, other than Thalresh (the bad guy), are female hybrids ships originally created by a race that were around at the time of a multiverse explosion (think Big Bang in n dimensional space resulting in millions of universes being spawned).</p>

<p>Their purpose was to carry the Yiss into these new child universes, simply to explore. However, to do this, they communicate with the given universe. The first pair of ships were to be what we might call pure blood, solely machine in origin. However, space folding was extremely distressing and difficult for these ships. The problem was solved by the ultimate grandmother of the race who determined that the missing ingredient existed in sentient races of a certain capacity. </p>

<p>All her descendents are half breeds, just as immortal as she but folding space and other forms of FTL travel are as natural to these ships as breathing is to a mammal.</p>

<p>This project is my ongoing exploration of blender for the 3D work - it's a big area 3D design &amp; animation, one I started in November 2014. Along with the project there are story snippets and ideas on their home site. </p>
